 *How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
 ***Through effective unit test, code reviews, and encapsulation.***
 *How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
 ***User needs a incorporated through requirements gathering and the creation of Use Cases.***
 *How do I approach designing software?
 ***My approach to designing software is through requirements gathering, from there, development of use cases. Once some use cases are developed, researching into already existing solutions. This creates more use cases. Then development of process flows and activity, sequence, and class diagrams. Creation of process flows will play a vital role in the future. I believe process flows will help me better recognize the different components to a system and further develop use cases. Process Flows will help me create a level of organization within the SDLC to learn and grow from.***
